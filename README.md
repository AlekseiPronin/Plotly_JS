# Plotly_JS

## Purpose

The main purpose of this project was to create accesible, attractive and interactive data visualisations for the web using Plotly library of JavaScript. 

The data was stored in external .json file on the local machine. The file was accessed through the additional .js file and D3 functions. Also, other finctions were created in the same .js file to manipulate and receive the data suittable for visualisation. Based on that data bar chart, bubble chart and gauge chart were created.

The index.html file was created to contain the structure of the web page. In the end the Bootstrap was used to polish the visialisation.
